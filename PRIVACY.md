# ScaddleToy Terms of Service and Privacy Policy

## License of Your Models

All models ("scaddles") you submit to ScaddleToy belong to you. You decide which license applies to every model you create. We recommend that you paste your preferred license at the top of your code. If you do not specify a license, your model will be protected by the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) License by default.

However, by posting a model to ScaddleToy, you grant ScaddleToy a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use your model (including to reproduce, distribute, modify, display, and perform it) for the purpose of operating, promoting, and improving ScaddleToy.

When you post a model to ScaddleToy, you agree to allow others to view and fork your model. You also grant other websites permission to embed your Public and Unlisted models via our embed tools.

## Public Information

ScaddleToy is a public platform. All models you share as Public or Unlisted become visible to everyone:

- **Unlisted** models do not appear in the Browse section, but are visible to anyone with a direct link.
- **Public** models are visible and searchable in the Browse section and accessible to anyone.
- **Draft** models are private and not shared with anyone.

When you publish a model or post a comment, your username and comments are visible to anyone who visits ScaddleToy. Your profile, including your avatar and bio, is also public. You can edit your profile information and picture at any time.

ScaddleToy allows third parties to access Public Information via the ScaddleToy JSON API.

## Private Information

ScaddleToy respects your privacy and will not use your data for advertising or contact you for profit.

We collect email addresses to create unique user accounts. Your email may be used to send notifications (e.g., when someone comments on your model). You can opt out of these emails in your profile settings.

All private information, including your email address and drafts, is never shared with or sold to any organization or service.

## Account Deletion

You can delete your ScaddleToy account from your account settings. When you delete your account, all your data, including models and comments, is permanently deleted. This action is irreversible. You can export your data before deleting your account.

## Cookies and Analytics

Cookies are required to use ScaddleToy. They are used to identify users and keep sessions open. Without cookies, ScaddleToy will not function.

ScaddleToy does not use third-party tracking scripts, analytics services, or advertising. Your browsing behavior is not monitored or shared.

## Terms of Service

You are responsible for the content you create on ScaddleToy. ScaddleToy reserves the right to suspend or delete any user account and to block any models or assets without notice. We encourage freedom of speech and diversity of opinions, but do not tolerate content that threatens individuals or communities.

ScaddleToy is a platform for human-crafted creative coding. Models that appear to be primarily AI-generated may be set to Unlisted at our discretion.

By using ScaddleToy, you acknowledge that running code in your browser carries risks. You assume all responsibility when browsing, running, or editing models. ScaddleToy takes no responsibility for possible hardware, software, or OS damage, or for security issues due to malicious content. However, we will do our best to minimize such risks and remove suspicious or malicious content as soon as possible.

## Changes

ScaddleToy's Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this policy without your explicit consent. Continued use of the service after changes means you agree to the revised policy. Significant changes will be announced more prominently.

If ScaddleToy is acquired or merged with another company, you will be notified before any personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
