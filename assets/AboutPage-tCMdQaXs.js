**ScaddleToy** is a web-based OpenSCAD playground and model gallery. It allows users to write, edit, and preview OpenSCAD code directly in the browser, leveraging a WASM-compiled OpenSCAD engine.

It is built with Vite, React, PrimeReact, Supabase, ZenFS, Google Model Viewer and Monaco Editor. ScaddleToy aims to make parametric 3D modeling accessible and collaborative for everyone.

## AI Disclaimer

Some parts of ScaddleToy were developed under the assistance of AI tools (GitHub Copilot, OpenAI). Without AI, ScaddleToy would not have been possible in the amount of time I (markusmo3) put into it. I am an advocate of AI and its potential to change the world, even though i also see the risks and downsides. When AI is used as a tool, instead of just blindly relying on it, it can increase the efficiency and sometimes even quality of the work. The fact that I was able to very quickly develop ScaddleToy in an MVP manner is a testament to this. I do find it important to clearly label AI-generated and AI-assisted content, though.

If you as a user of ScaddleToy use AI to generate source code, please at least label it as such and give credit to relevant sources.
